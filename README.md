First-Steps
===========

These are some basic command terminal programs I wrote for CS1036 at the University of Western Ontario. All of the following programs are written in c++.

The class was instructed by Dr. Quazi Rahman and I recieved a final grade of 98% in this class. 
I'm currently moving forwards by self-teaching myself Java.
